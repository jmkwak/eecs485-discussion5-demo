## Objective

Create a react widget that generates random words. The widget should display a 
list of words along with a button that adds a new word to the list.

## Setup

### React Dev Tools
It will be wildly useful to install React dev tools before continuing on
with this demo. You can find React dev tools in the chrome web store 
[here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi)
or in the firefox web store 
[here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/)

You'll need to create a new python virtual
environment and a node environment as well as install the proper python and 
node packages. We've included a `setup.py` and `package.json` for you in this 
repository. Thus you can create the environments and install the packages with 
the following commands:
```shellsession
$ cd $DEMO_ROOT
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install nodeenv
$ nodeenv --python-virtualenv
$ source env/bin/activate  # again, after installing node
$ pip install -e .
$ npm install .
```

## Overview

### `randomsite`
We provide a Flask app named `randomsite`. The `randomsite` app can be started
with the provided executable `./bin/randomsiterun`.

`randomsite` has two routes: `/api/v1/random/` and `/`. The `/api/v1/random/` 
route is an API used to retrieve random words and `/` will be where your react 
widget will be placed.

#### Random API (`/api/v1/random/`)

An API is provided to you that will generate random words. You can test this 
API by querying the API with httpie.

Start the app in one terminal:
```shellsession
$ cd $DEMO_ROOT
$ ./bin/randomsiterun
```

In another terminal query the API with `httpie`:
```shellsession
$ http "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/random/"
```

#### Random Widget (`/`) and React

The random widget will be placed on the main page at route `/`. We've already 
coded the route for the main page as well as the template used. See 
`randomsite/views/index.py` and `randomsite/templates/index.html` for more 
details.

Your job will be to complete the implementation of the random widget started
in `randomsite/js/randomwidget.jsx`. There are comments in the file with hints
regarding which order to implement. These comments also give hints about what 
each function should accomplish.

It's also worth studying how `randomsite/templates/index.html`, 
`randomsite/js/main.jsx`, `randomsite/js/randomwidget.jsx` interact with one 
another. Note that `randomsite/templates/index.html` references 
`randomsite/static/js/bundle.js` which is the compiled form of the react 
components in `randomsite/js/`.

#### Component Heirarchy

Now we will take this a step further to demonstrate how a page can be comprised of multiple components.  
On our main page, we want to display "random pannel."  A random pannel consists of a random number of 
randomwidgets.  This random number should be obtained from your api at the route `/api/v1/number/`.  The 
random pannel should be a new component, which you'll implement in `randomsite/js/randompannel.jsx`.  You'll 
want to modify `randomsite/js/main.jsx` to render the random pannel component, instead of the random widget. 
**You shouldn't have to modify your code in `randomsite/js/randomwidget.jsx`**
